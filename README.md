# Video Router / Feedback Tool

An app originally created for experimenting with digital feedback loops on the GPU, and used as part of a workshop [Cosmic Ghosts](https://www.lunchmeatfestival.cz/2018/program/workshop), part of Lunchmeat Festival 2018. Variously, it does:

* Two-channel VJ app; videos can be loaded by dragging and dropping onto either channel
* [ISF format shaders](https://www.interactiveshaderformat.com/) loaded the same way
* Syphon input and output; feedback loop can be created via Syphon or:
* Master channel output/input feedback loop
* For analogue experiments, 32bit version supports older CVBS USB capture dongles

Updates on their way, just as soon as I finish [ofxFluidUi](https://github.com/autr/ofxFluidUi) :)
